# agent.me - Create Your AI Twin

## What is this?

agent.me is a web application that generates a personalized AI agent based on your unique personality, communication style, and work patterns. Instead of using generic AI assistants, you can create one that actually thinks and responds like you.

## Why would you use it?

**The problem:** AI assistants are generic. They don't know how you communicate, what you're an expert in, or how you approach problems. You end up re-explaining context every conversation.

**The solution:** agent.me analyzes how you actually communicate and creates a custom AI persona that mirrors your style. Use it to:

- **Delegate tasks** to an AI that writes like you
- **Create a digital twin** for async communication
- **Train team members** on how you think and work
- **Automate responses** that match your voice

## How it works

1. **Upload your ChatGPT export** - We analyze your conversation history to understand your communication patterns, interests, and expertise
2. **Or take a questionnaire** - Answer questions about your work style, tools, and preferences
3. **Get your agent files** - Download AGENT.md, SKILLS.md, and a ready-to-use system prompt
4. **Chat with your agent** - Test it in real-time before deploying
5. **Use anywhere** - Works with ChatGPT Custom Instructions, Claude Projects, or any LLM API

## Privacy-first

All analysis happens in the browser. We never store or transmit your conversations.
